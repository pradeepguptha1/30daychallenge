441. Arranging Coins
Easy
You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. 
The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2^31 -1

//solution
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        int low=0,high=n;
        while (low<=high){
            long mid=(low+high)/2;
            long sum=mid*(mid+1)/2;
            if (sum==n){
                return (int)mid;
            }
            else if(sum<n){
                low= (int) mid + 1;
                }
            else{
                high=(int) mid-1;
            }
        }
        return (int)high;
    }
}
